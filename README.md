这是一个在https://github.com/kazuki-vim/bose-qc45-firmware?tab=readme-ov-file  

的基础上修改的图像化界面的qc45降级脚本。  

不再需要安装依赖环境（不少人饱受pip3之苦）  

希望能帮助更多的人完成降级操作  

水平有限，使用了gpt辅助完成，请大佬们见谅（QwQ）  

下面是免责声明！！！  

虽然降级了固件，但降噪问题并没有解决（那就不是固件的锅） 

降级不是 Bose 官方支持的操作，您需要承担对自己的设备进行变砖的所有责任。  

仅在 Windows11 上进行了测试  

fireware和main.exe放在一个文件夹里面就可以用了  

先点开始监测在进行固件升级操作就可以了  


This is a graphical interface-based downgrading script for the Bose QC45, modified on the basis of https://github.com/kazuki-vim/bose-qc45-firmware?tab=readme-ov-file.  

There is no longer a need to install the dependency environment (many people have suffered a lot from using pip3).  

I hope it can help more people complete the downgrading operation.  

Due to my limited skills, I used GPT to assist in its completion. I sincerely apologize to the experts (QwQ).  

Here comes the disclaimer!!!  

Although the firmware has been downgraded, the noise reduction issue has not been resolved (in that case, it's not the firmware's fault).  

Downgrading is not an operation supported by Bose officially, and you need to bear all the responsibilities for bricking your own device.  

It has only been tested on Windows 11.  

Just put the firmware and main.exe in the same folder, and then it can be used.  

Click "Start Monitoring" first, and then perform the firmware downgrading operation.
